A full-stack MERN application designed for food enthusiasts to share and discover recipes. This platform enables users to browse recipes by category, create their own, rate and review others' recipes, and explore trending and curated collections.

# Key Features

# Recipe Exploration: Browse recipes by category, trending status, and popularity.
# User Interaction: Review, rate, and save recipes to favorites (restrictions apply).
# Recipe Creation: Users can create, edit, and share their own recipes.
# Optimized API Calls: RTK Query for efficient and centralized API data fetching.
# Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
# Testing: Includes Jest for unit testing.
# Error Handling: Middleware for centralized error management in the frontend.

# Technologies Used

# Frontend
  # React.js: For building the user interface.
  # React Router: For single-page application navigation.
  # Redux Toolkit (RTK): State management with RTK Query for API calls
  # MaterialUI: For responsive design.
  # CSS Modules: For modular and reusable styles.

# Backend
  # Node.js: Runtime for the backend server.
  # Express.js: Web framework for routing and middleware.
  # MongoDB: NoSQL database for recipe and user data storage.
  # Testing
  # Jest: For unit testing on both frontend and backend.
  # Other Tools
  # JWT (JSON Web Token): For secure authentication.
  # dotenv: For managing environment variables.
  # Middleware: Error handling in the frontend for consistent user experience.

# RTK Query for API Calls
The project leverages Redux Toolkit's RTK Query for efficient data fetching and caching. All API calls are managed through a centralized api slice, which simplifies state management and reduces boilerplate code.

# Setup
    API calls are defined in src/services/api.ts. For example:

    import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react';
    export const recipeApi = createApi({
    reducerPath: 'recipeApi',
    baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/api' }),
    endpoints: (builder) => ({
        getRecipes: builder.query({
        query: () => 'recipes',
        }),
        getRecipeById: builder.query({
        query: (id) => `recipes/${id}`,
        }),
        createRecipe: builder.mutation({
        query: (recipe) => ({
            url: 'recipes',
            method: 'POST',
            body: recipe,
        }),
        }),
    }),
    });

    export const { useGetRecipesQuery, useGetRecipeByIdQuery, useCreateRecipeMutation } = recipeApi;

# Usage
    Components use hooks auto-generated by RTK Query:

    import { useGetRecipesQuery } from '../api/recipeApi';
    const RecipeList = () => {
    const { data: recipes, error, isLoading } = useGetRecipesQuery();

    if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error loading recipes</p>;

    return (
        <ul>
        {recipes.map((recipe) => (
            <li key={recipe.id}>{recipe.name}</li>
        ))}
        </ul>
    );
    };


# Usage
 # Homepage
    Explore the featured carousel, recipe categories, and curated collections.
    View trending and most-viewed recipes.
 # Recipe Detail Page
    Rate and review recipes by other users.
    Mark recipes as favorites for easy access.
 # Create Recipe
    Share your own recipes through a user-friendly form.


# Testing
    The project uses Jest for unit testing on both the frontend and backend.

 # Running Tests
        npm test
 # Test Coverage
        Includes tests for controllers, middleware, and utility functions in the backend.
        Covers React components, hooks, and Redux actions in the frontend.

# Error Handling
    The project implements error handling in both frontend and backend:
 # Frontend
    A dedicated middleware catches and displays errors in a user-friendly format. Examples include:
        Network failures.
        Invalid form submissions.
# Troubleshooting
  # Common Issues
   # Frontend cannot connect to backend:
    Confirm the backend server is running on port 5000.
    Check the proxy setting in frontend/package.json.

   # Tests fail:
    Ensure required environment variables are set for testing.
    Verify all dependencies are installed.

# Future Enhancements
 # Add user profiles with activity history.
 # Implement advanced search and filtering.
 # Enhance test coverage with integration tests.
